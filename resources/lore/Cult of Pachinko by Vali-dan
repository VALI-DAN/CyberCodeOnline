Welcome to the Cult of Pachinko! 
Well, that's what they call us
But we're really just pachinko enthusiasts
A community of pachinko players
We trust the pachinko and it's generous pulls
We are here to teach all of shangri-la
Pachinko is love, pachinko is life *^*

The pachinko pledge: 
We pledge allegiance to pachinko
Under the united plays of pachinko
And to the pachinko way for which we pull
One btc, decentralized currency
With 32x plays and prizes for all

The pachinko prayer:
We pray to thee, o mighty pachinko
Our btc belongs to you
Bless us, o majestic pachinko
For the gifts that we may pull
Give us pachinko daily
And forgive us when we don't spend btc
For pachinko deserves all our currency
For pachinko is love, pachinko is life
Aaaaaaahmen
